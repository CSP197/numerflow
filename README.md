# numerflow
Data workflows for the numer.ai machine learning competition

## Status
I just started to work on this, and a lot is not optimal. I'm glad if you have
any feedback, so just open up an issue (if there isn't already one). If you
have specific tasks that you want to see implemented, hit me up via the issues,
twitter or slack (@rogue).

## Tasks
Currently implemented:
* fetch and extract the datasets
* train and predict
* automatic upload (WIP)

### Planned
* automated dataviz and analysis (seaborn, nbconvert executed) in a jupyter
notebook

## Documentation
### `FetchAndExtractData`
Fetches the dataset zipfile and extracts the contents to `output-path`.

#### Parameters
* `output-path`: where the datasets should be saved eventually (defaults to
    `./data/`)
* `dataset-path`: URI of the remote dataset (defaults to `https://datasets.numer.ai/57b4899/numerai_datasets.zip`)

### `TrainAndPredict`
Trains a Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes classifier and predicts the targets. Output file
is saved at `output-path` with a custom, timestamped file name.

#### Parameters
* `output-path`: where the datasets should be saved eventually (defaults to
    `./data/`)
* `dataset-path`: URI of the remote dataset (defaults to `https://datasets.numer.ai/57b4899/numerai_datasets.zip`)

### `UploadPredictions`
Uploads the predictions of not already uploaded.

**Note: the actual file upload does not work yet**

#### Parameters
* `output-path`: where the datasets should be saved eventually (defaults to
    `./data/`)
* `dataset-path`: URI of the remote dataset (defaults to `https://datasets.numer.ai/57b4899/numerai_datasets.zip`)
* `usermail`: user email
* `userpass`: user password
* `filepath`: path to the file ought to be uploaded

## Usage
Prepare the project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the complete pipeline:
```
env PYTHONPATH='' luigi --local-scheduler --module workflow Workflow --usermail="YOUR_MAIL" --userpass="YOUR_PASS"
```
